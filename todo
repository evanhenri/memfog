# FIXME permission error when attempting to EXEC embedded instruction

check if embedded instruction exists
    if yes, expand content
        ...
    on exit, if [PATH] content changed, update data at PATH


# fixme, exception thrown if ctrl-L pressed in INSERT mode

# fixme, \t (tab) characters appear as ?




# FIXME cannot paste special characters into records

-------------------------

# TODO if embedded instruction exist
#           if instruction is altered
#               change instruction text in db record.
#           else
#               change content of linked document and leave db text unchaged

# TODO ALL TAGS SHOULD NOT BE MARKUP, MAKE THEM USE JSON INSTEAD!!!
# TODO place all content that appears on screen in markup instruction
#   if record content is pulled from database, its raw view would show
#       [TITLE](title text)
#       [KEYWORDS](keyword text)
#       [BODY](body text)
#   this works well with [PATH] and [EXEC] embedded instructions because it would allow referencing
#       different record text components instead of trying to look through 1 huge blob of text
#   these tags could be automatically inserted when a record was added so that they were already a part
#       of the content when the record was displayed - their presence would not be seen as a 'change'
#       to the record content when the record was exited

# TODO if a record has an embedded [EXEC] statement, if the program takes arguements in order to
#   execute, see if possible for memfog to pause the prgrams execution and allow the user to
#   enter arguements at the command line, pass those to the program, and continue resume the
#   programs execution


# TODO check if global keyword record exist and if so, interpret all keywords specified as equivalent in searching
#       e.g. Global record: [drawing]table=[work]bench=(night stand) // [this keyword is optional], (all contained keywords required)

# TODO if ! at end of keyword search, automatically load the highest matching record

# TODO when scrolling history cmd, cursor should be at end of string so next text gets appended
# TODO toggle between raw content (to display embedded instructions) shown content from it from within the UI by providing the :r command
# TODO add ability to have keyword=key=word in the keyword area of a record to denote that all words connected with = should be treated as the same
# TODO add ability to set global aliases, eg db == database in all cases
